![Alt text](https://gemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Logo-grey-en.svg "Title")

**Gemini Clone** is a simple, intuitive search application that allows users to search for content by entering a prompt. It mimics the core search functionality found in the Gemini platform but does not rely on a backend API. Instead, it uses **React Context Hook** to manage the state and display relevant content based on user input.

## `Features`

- **Search by Prompt:** Enter a search prompt and get relevant content displayed instantly.
- **Context Hook for State Management:** Uses Reactâ€™s Context API to manage the search state and content display without the need for a backend.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## `Tech Stack`

- **Vite-ReactJS:** Vite is a next-generation build tool for fast and optimized React development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive design.
- **React Context API:** Used for managing the global state (search prompt and results) within the app, ensuring efficient state management without a backend.
